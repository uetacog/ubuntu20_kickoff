# ubuntu20_kickoff
Setup script for clean Ubuntu 20.04 system

This script is to get a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 system to where I like it.


Most of the tools are geared to SDR/Radio and sysadmin.

If you find use in it, please use it.   

You can use it two ways;

1) `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uetacog/ubuntu20_kickoff/master/ubuntu_20.04_package_install.sh | bash`

2) `git clone https://github.com/uetacog/ubuntu20_kickoff.git`  
`cd ubuntu20_kickoff`  
`bash ubuntu_20.04_package_install.sh`  

If you do option 1, its worth at least looking at the code before you go blindly run something some rando put on github.

This is made for 20.04 Ubuntu, but should work with other Deb distros and possibly previous versions.
